possiblity of harm | intro to probabilty


probability is one way to  describe the possibility of harm

what kind of probability?
 - there are multiple defintions of probability from diff schools of thought
 -

 author - subjective view
rooted in the works of Ramsey and de Finetti,  
with some “correctives” from Jaynes  to avoid the mind projection fallacy.

fallacy works in two ways
 - our viewpoint is absolute truth T  (fatal mistake in risk management)
 - just because we dont know something, it must be unknowable to everyone else

- mind projection fallacy is an example of how social media works - ? (7:30)
 - mistaken belief that others feel the same way we do
 - social media often amplifies this effect by showing users content that reinforces their beliefs

diff ideas of probabilty and when they might be useful - 
we are dealing with random phenomena
mass random phenomena  <> single or one-shot phenomena.

** mass random phenomena ** 
- hard/impossible to predict at micro level but predictable/manageable at macro level
- example - open air terrace with no roof  - rains - 20 tiles - probability of rain drop falling on a given tile
Where will the 15th drop land?
That’s really tough to answer. Even  with a model like a Poisson process,  
any answer would still be  a very bad approximation.

This information, plus the data we gather  on where and how raindrops have fallen,  
helps us study the event  “15th raindrop on tile X.”


** single shot phenomena ***
there’s no  historical information; at best we can  
draw analogies with phenomena we believe to  be similar, but that’s not always helpful.

ex - What’s the probability that a drone flying over  
an airport like JFK will cause a  plane crash with many casualties?

What’s the probability of a  specific genetic mutation?

our goal - try to answer these questions sometimes a precise answer cannot be found


Probability is one way to  represent randomness.
Given an event,  its probability is expressed as  a real number between 0 and 1.

probability of event = 1 - certain/almost certain
- there might be multiple definitions of probability
- under one model - 1 under a diff model - 0.87

nothing is ever 100%  certain—not even certainty itself.

assumption --------------------

if an event is impossible  according to one definition or model,  
it will also be impossible under  any other definition or model.

difference between probabilites - error or distortion

probability - number between 0 and 1

Pierre-Simon Laplace:  
“The theory of probabilities is at bottom  nothing but common sense reduced to calculus.”
