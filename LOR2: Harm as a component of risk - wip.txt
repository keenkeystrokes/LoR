definition of risk

risk is the possiblity of harm - an event with negative consequences
which can potentially be contained atleast partially.


management of risk
to manage risk we need precision

how can we evaluate harm? - extent of harm?
- its subjective
- difficult to separate harm and the subject to which harm implies

ex - consider a loss of 1k dollars - impact would be more to a poor person than a rich person

impact or magnitude of harm - nature, extent ,timing (Keeney and Rescher)
(Ralph Keeney? Nicholas Rescher? )

1. nature - type of harm - financial, physical injury, death, boredom?
