definition of risk

risk is the possiblity of harm - an event with negative consequences
which can potentially be contained atleast partially.


management of risk
to manage risk we need precision

how can we evaluate harm? - extent of harm?
- its subjective
- difficult to separate harm and the subject to which harm implies

ex - consider a loss of 1k dollars - impact would be more to a poor person than a rich person

impact or magnitude of harm - nature, extent ,timing (Keeney and Rescher)
(Ralph Keeney? Nicholas Rescher? )

1. NATURE - type of harm - financial, physical injury, death, boredom?
2. EXTENT - more quantitative in nature - can be divided into severity and distribution.
  2.1. severity - some measure of loss. how much?
  2.2. distribution - individuals affected by harm AND their number. (statistical blur?). ex - 3 firefighters who died fighting a specific fire or in general job fatalites in year 2024
 - our relationship with the people harmed
3. TIIMING


to eval and compare risks and thus rank them we need to measure and quantify risk
 - this is ambiguous


** risk profile - 8:13

** Risks are NOT comparable **
- comparing risk is trivial - can't just calc 2 nums and put them side by side- author calls them illusions of comparability - 9:53
- example workdays calc - 2 person vs 15k person...

** fundamental aspect of risk management ** 
The fact that different parameters we use to  estimate harm may not be commensurableâ€”especially between different types of harm

then what?

1. fix the nature of harm
2. then compare extent and timing - severity, distribution and timing
 - worst harm - high, high, high (11:57)
