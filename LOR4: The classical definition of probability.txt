probability = 20% = 0.2
complement = negation = 80% = 0.8 (1 - 0.2 = 0.8)

What happens if our model says the  event is impossible, yet it actually  happens?
In general, we should never consider any event completely impossible  
or completely certain, 
unless we’re talking  about special cases—usually purely logical  


** Cromwell's rules
an event can  be
1. simple - rolling a 3 on a dice
2. composite - rolling an event number on a dice

sample space - set of all possible outcomes of random phenomena

empty/impossible event - opp of sample space - probab is always 0 - rolling a 7 on standard dice

event space  - set of all possible outcomes | all possible combinations of those outcomes
 - simple + composite events

 mutually exclusive events
