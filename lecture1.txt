risk isn't something to avoid completely - risk opens up opportunities

risk is mathematically a compound concept - product of multiple components
1. the damage
2. probability of the damage

when we can't quantify either of these we call it uncertainity

**** definition of risk *****
“the possibility of a negative event—that is, 
one that causes damage—brought about by internal and/or external vulnerabilities 
which can potentially (at least  partially) be contained or even prevented.”

internal factors - endogenous
external factors - exogeneous

ex - me driving a car risk of an accident can be due to me or outside events. more control over internal factors.

- damage is subjective. risk cannot be separated from the group or individual to which harm is inflicted.

risks (are different)- 
1. risks we take - choice of action - we deliberately do or don't do something
2. risks we are subjected too -  natural  disasters, pandemics, or economic/financial crises  - we are defensive


risk and uncertainity are dynamic concepts. transition into one another.

"it’s better to assume risks you can quantify than to quantify risks you’ve already assumed."
 - <todo - try to understand this>

** Sigmund Freud **
“When you  eliminate risk from your life, little remains.”
